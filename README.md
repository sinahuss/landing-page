# Landing Page
For access to the live web page, I used [GitHub Pages](https://sinahuss.github.io/landing-page/)  

I've created a landing page as practice for my flexbox skills. Below are my thoughts
and list of points I've learned while completing this project.  

- Flexbox is powerful but deceptively simple
- "display: flex;" is for flex containers, "flex: ...;" is for flex children
- Flexbox can be easily applied to lists for a simple navbar
- Making things stretch on the page is easy with "max-width: x%;" and "width: 100%"
  - This will force it to cover the specified percentage of the page horizontally
  - Later I learned to use the viewport through "vh", "vw", and "vmin"
- Many predefined HTML tags have default margins which can screw with Flexbox
- Use "object-fit: cover" to place big images in small windows without shrinking the image
